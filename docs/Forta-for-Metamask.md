**Risk Assessment Indicators**

By accessing the Forta tab, users are presented with one of two indicators:

`High Risk`: This label signifies that the address being interacted with has prior associations with scam activities. Caution is advised.

`Low Risk`: This label indicates that there's no known record of the address being involved in scam-related activities. However, users should still exercise their own due diligence.

**Usage**

Click the Forta Tab in MetaMask: Once you've initiated a transaction, navigate to the Forta tab within the MetaMask transaction window.

Check the Risk Level: On the Forta tab, you'll see a risk assessment label, either "High Risk" or "Low Risk", which gives you an indication of the potential risk associated with the address.
