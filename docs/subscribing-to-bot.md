# Subscribing to Alerts 

The Forta Network allows users to access the intel generated by detection bots through a variety of methods. Intel can be accessed through the GraphQL API (pull) or by subscribing to a bot directly (push) and receiving notifications via email, Slack, Telegram, Discord or webhooks. Purchasing one or more network subscriptions will give users access to both. 

Here’s a step-by-step guide to subscribing directly to a bot:

## Subscribing from the Bot’s Profile Page

Step 1: Search for the detection bot you’d like to receive alerts from and go to its profile page in the Forta App. Make sure to sign in to the App with your wallet.

Once in the bot’s profile page, click on the “Subscribe” button at the top right.

    You will only see the “Subscribe” button if you have already purchased the corresponding plan (or received a free trial) with the wallet you have signed in with.

Step 2: A new window will appear with a subscription form with the Bot ID pre-filled. You will have the option to add custom filters (e.g. only receive alerts related to a specific address), and be asked to select your preferred notification channel (Slack, Telegram, Email, Discord or Webhook).
