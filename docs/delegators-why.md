# Why Delegate

By delegating your FORT tokens in Forta's Scanner Pools you are increasing the security and reliability of the network by increasing the skin in the game and signaling the best and most reliable Scanner Pools, helping them get incentivized.

For that service, the Scanner Pool owners will share their rewards with delegators, charging them a % fee on the rewards obtained.

Every reward epoch, SLA scores for scanners of the pool will be measured, along with the variations on stake allocation. After the end of the epoch, a reward in FORT will be assigned to the pool in the reward distribution smart contract, which will also distribute the rewards between owners and delegators.

To learn more about rewards, visit the [Rewards Formula page](/rewards).

In accordance with Forta Network's mission of securing web3, delegated stakes will be subject to the possibility of a small partial slashing in case the pool they are delegating to is slashed (either by technical reasons or misconduct)

Delegators are subject to waiting periods for undelegation (10 days), after which they can reclaim their FORT.

# Choosing a Scanner Pool to delegate

Choosing a Scanner Pool is an important task, and there are several factor to take into account before delegating:

- Historic SLA (performance score) of the pool's scanners.
- Delegation Fee (% of rewards the Pool Owner keeps from delegator's rewards).
- Check if the pool is allocating the stake to capacity (unallocated stake does not earn rewards but it's subject to slashing).
- Number of nodes in relationship with allocated stake (sometimes the network will reward allocations spread among many nodes, other time stake concentrations, deppending in network conditions expressed by the parameters in the Rewards Formula)
- Info presented by the pool owner in their profile page
- Active communication with delegators in Forta's Discord.
