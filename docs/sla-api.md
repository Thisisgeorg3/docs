# Scan Node SLA API

To evaluate the health of nodes in the network, Forta calculates a score (SLA) based on node activity.  This score is a 0-1 score where higher is better.  This calculation will evolve as more factors are considered.

## SLA Calculation

See [SLA](sla.md) for details regarding the composition of the SLA score.

## API

To make this score visible, we now have an API that anyone can call for a given scanner address.  Simply curl the API to get a summary report for the period you are interested in.

        - `latest_block_threshold` - Threshold used for evaluation of the latest block 
        - `inspection_score` - The Resource score for the node (see [SLA](sla.md) for details)
    - `scores` - Subscores that led to overall score for this minute
        - `name` - Name of score
        - `value` - Value of score (0-1)
        - `weight` - Weight towards overall score
    
### Subscores

#### From minutes (affects hour)

  - `batch_score` - 0-1 score for `batch_count` vs `expected_batch_count`
    - Score is proportional (4 = 1, 3 = 0.75, 2 = 0.50, 1 = 0.25, 0 = 0)
    - Exceeding also decreases score (4 = 1, 5 = 0.75, 6 = 0.50, 7 = 0.25, 8 = 0)

  - `latest_block` - 0-1 score for `latest_block` vs `expected_latest_block`
    - Full credit for being at or above `expected_latest_block` (within 100 blocks)
    - Decreases from 1 to 0 if `latest_block` is below `expected_latest_block`, until 100 blocks behind (score = 0)

#### From hour (affects final score)

  - `reporting_success` - 0-1 score for total `batch_score` within the hour vs. `expected_(min|max)_reporting_success`.
    - Score is proportional between `[0,min]`. Min is 59 for bot-assigned nodes and 3 for idle nodes.
    - The sum does not exceed 60 in an hour.
  - `input_performance` - 0-1 score for average `latest_block` score within the hour vs. `expected_input_performance` (i.e. 1).
    - The average is calculated using reported minutes.
    - An idle and a bot-assigned node can have the same score although they report at different rates.
