## Overview
The Scam Detector is an ideal source of threat intel for Web 3 wallets and dashboard tools, as well as for security and compliance solutions serving a retail or institutional audience. Use the Scam Detector to build or supplement a black list, or as a transaction analysis tool by querying the Scam Detector at the point of approval or transaction to determine whether they are malicious. 


The Scam Detector provides threat intelligence about malicious smart contracts and EOAs engaging in scams and other end user attacks. It relies on a *bundle* of underlying Forta bots, each monitoring for a specific threat type (ex: Ice Phishing). The Scam Detector and its underlying bots are collectively maintained by the Forta community, including the Forta Foundation, Nethermind, and dozens of individual security researchers and developers.

## How it works
Forta bots are monitoring on-chain activity 24/7/365. Some bots leverage a heuristic-based approach, others leverage machine learning to identify malicious activity. When bots identify an attack or scam on-chain, they create two types of threat intelligence:


- **Labels.** A persistent tag placed on an entity (smart contract or EOA) responsible for a scam or attack. Today, the Scam Detector assigns two labels: “scammer-eoa” and “scammer-contract”. Labels also feature the threat type via the alert ID field (ex: ICE PHISHING), a link to the description of the alert ID, and a confidence score from 0 to 1. 


- **Alerts.** Findings emitted in real-time by a bot about something that happened on-chain. Example, if a flashloan occurred in the last block, a bot monitoring for flashloan transactions would emit an alert on that flashloan when the next block is confirmed. Alerts from the Scam Detector contain metadata about the transaction(s) that triggered the alert, the entities involved and the threat type.      


The Scam Detector currently monitors on-chain activity for the following threat types:


- Ice phishing
- Social engineering native ice phishing
- Fraudulent Seaport/Blur orders
- Address poisoning
- NFT Wash trading


New threat types are regularly added to the Scam Detector by the Forta community. 


Here’s a [glossary](https://forta.org/attacks/) defining threat types in more detail. 

## Using the Scam Detector  
Scam Detector *labels* and *alerts* are each available in the [Forta GraphQL API](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/forta-api-reference/). **Currently, no API key is required.** 

### *Labels*
Labels can be found in our [Forta GraphQL API](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/forta-api-reference/) documentation. 

This is an example query one can use to query Labels.
```
query Labels($input: LabelsInput) {
  labels(input: $input) {
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor {
        pageToken
      }
    }
    labels {
      createdAt
      id
      label {
        confidence
        entity
        entityType
        label
        metadata
        remove
      }
      source {
        alertHash
        alertId
        id
        bot {
          id
          image
          imageHash
          manifest
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These inputs will find the first 100 scammer-eoa and scammer-contract labels for the Scam Detector feed, since a certain date.  If a label was later removed, it will not be returned because `state:true` is set.
```
{
  "input": {
    "labels": ["scammer-eoa", "scammer-contract"],
    "first": 100,
    "state": true,
    "createdSince": 1680877408000,
    "sourceIds": ["0x1d646c4045189991fdfd24a66b192a294158b839a6ec121d740474bdacb3ab23"]
  }
}
```

For more information on searching for labels, see the `LabelsInput` structure in the [API Documentation](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/forta-api-reference/#definition-LabelsInput).

### *Alerts*

Whereas labels tell you what the Forta Network knows about a particular entity, alerts tell you something happened (i.e. an attack). There are two ways to access alerts: the API (pull) and subscription (push). You can access the Alerts API [here](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/api/). Alternatively, If you want alerts *pushed* to you in real-time, you can also [subscribe](https://explorer.forta.network/bot/0x1d646c4045189991fdfd24a66b192a294158b839a6ec121d740474bdacb3ab23) to the Scam Detector directly and select your desired communication channel (webhook, email, Discord, Telegram, Slack).    

## What chains are supported?

- Ethereum
- BNB Chain
- Polygon
- Avalanche
- Arbitrum
- Optimism 
- Fantom 

The Forta community evaluates new chains on an ongoing basis.


## False Positives
While the Scam Detector maintains high precision, it’s possible that it identifies a false positive. To address this risk, the Forta community manually verifies certain Scam Detector alerts within one business day. If a false positive is identified during the manual verification process, an FP alert will be emitted by the Scam Detector and the label will be removed. If you’re accessing the Labels API via the state endpoint, all labels are up to date and take into account the latest FP information. 

## Confidence Scores
The confidence score associated with a label is hard coded and based on the precision analysis performed by the Forta community. The score is updated on a monthly basis, and reflects the accuracy of the Scam Detector for a particular alert ID/threat type *before* manual verification.
