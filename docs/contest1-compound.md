**Forta is thrilled to announce that we’ve partnered with Compound Grants to bring you our first bot development contest!**

Below you will find five challenges. Each challenge has a specific security concern that a Forta bot can solve, provided by Compound. Next to each challenge is a link to a Google Form, which you may use to submit a bot you develop that meets the challenge requirements to the contest judges.

- Only the first ten (10) submissions to each challenge that meet the challenge requirements below will be considered.

- After ten valid submissions are received, the Google Form will be closed and you will be unable to submit any further bots, so work fast!

- As long as submissions are still open, you are welcome to build bots for as many of these challenges as you can!

- Each winning bot will receive $1500 in COMP tokens, and a unique Forta NFT which will be provided at a later date when our NFT’s become available.

- To be eligible for a prize, you will be asked to submit a valid email and discord username through the google form, along with your bot.

- This contest will run from Oct. 20th through Oct. 27th, after which no further submissions will be considered.

- Winners will be chosen by a panel of bot reviewers from Forta community member Nethermind, and will be announced on Oct. 29th.

- For any questions, please contact a Forta Moderator on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fortanetwork).
