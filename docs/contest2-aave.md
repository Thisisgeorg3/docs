**Forta is thrilled to announce that we’ve partnered with Aave Grants DAO to bring you our second bot development contest!**

Below you will find five challenges. Each challenge has a specific security concern that a Forta bot can solve, provided by Aave. Next to each challenge is a link to a Google Form, which you may use to submit a bot you develop that meets the challenge requirements to the contest judges.

- Only the first ten (10) submissions to each challenge that meet the challenge requirements below will be considered.

- After ten valid submissions are received, the Google Form will be closed and you will be unable to submit any further bots, so work fast! As long as submissions are still open, you are welcome to build bots for as many of these challenges as you can!

- Each winning bot will receive $1000 in AAVE tokens, and a unique Forta NFT which will be provided at a later date when our NFT’s become available. To be eligible for a prize, you will be asked to submit a valid email and discord username through the google form, along with your bot.

- This contest will run from Nov 3rd through Nov 10th, after which no further submissions will be considered.
  Winners will be chosen by a panel of bot reviewers from Forta community member Arbitrary Execution, and will be announced on Nov 12th.

- For any questions, please contact a Forta Moderator on [Discord](https://discord.com).
