# Subscribing to alerts

## Using Forta App

You can subscribe to alerts generated by your bot using the [Forta App subscriptions page](https://app.forta.network/notifications). You will first need to connect your Metamask wallet and sign a message to authenticate. Then you can create subscriptions to a bot ID or a contract address. Forta App currently supports email, Slack, Telegram, Discord and webhooks.

Check out this quick video tutorial on subscribing to alerts:

Once subscribed, this is what a Slack notification would look like:

## Using OpenZeppelin Defender

Alternatively, you could receive alerts using [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/), a security operations platform for Ethereum. Check out their [Forta integration docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/sentinel) to learn more.

Once you have your alert subscriptions set up, you are ready to learn about [maintaining your bot](maintaining.md).
